For this final project I combined my mid-course project with new skills I acquired until the end of the course. 




Methodology
1- Created a dataset with billboard’s Top 100 songs of the week
2- Created a combined dataset from Spotify and last.fm's songs (2006-2009, 2019-2020)
3 - Using Spotify’s API, collected information from all songs (genre, energy, danceability)
4- Calculated the distance between each song from Top 100 and the average of my personal dataset
5- Selected the 5 songs closest to my music taste and added to a Spotify playlist created through the API.


Tools
* Spotify api
* Billboard’s web scraping
*LAST.FM database
*Python
Outcomes:
1 - The music suggestion was good, but very different from my music taste;
2 - Large database with noise from party playlists and children’s music from babysitting could have skewed the model;
3-  Calculating the simple average distance could have also skewed the results;
4- Maybe it needs more data from Spotify (newer data);
5- Maybe trying to calculate the distance using a different method;
6- Maybe I have an eclectic musical taste;
7- Maybe all I needed to get back to music was to take the first step.
